Well, this really isn't a "Blog", but I guess I'm going to call it a blog...

###Real Introduction
Hi, I'm using a Ruby gem called Jekyll because GitHub supports it and It's awesome. I don't have to pay for my own website. I don't even have to worry about those weird free hosts doing "maintenance" on my site which makes it unable to be accessed on.

####Who I am...
I'm Jung Oh or Jung3o and I like to call myself a Web Developer. I love to work with HTML and CSS, but I guess anyone can learn that. I know PHP, but it's an easy language to learn so I guess that's that... I'm currently learning Python. Right now, I'm having so much fun making interesting things with python. Python is a powerfull tool/language that basically lets you do anything you want. You just have to be able to execute it.

###Oh, yeah about this site...
This site, as you can see, is still work in progress. As of right now, the "Recent Update" isn't done yet and the post pages aren't even finished. The "Recent Update" will have my github feeds and my twitter tweets.
