I started making MyBB plugins once again...

I'm not sure if it's a good thing or bad thing. I guess I'll see how it goes.

##My MyBB plugins are

* [Rate Me a Funny](http://mods.mybb.com/view/rate-me-a-funny "MyBB plugin page with screenshot")
* [Minecraft Premium User](http://mods.mybb.com/view/minecraft-premium-user "MyBB plugin page with screenshot")
* [Many New Posts](http://mods.mybb.com/view/many-new-posts "MyBB plugin page with screenshot")

### Rate Me a Funny
The plugin 
[Rate Me a Funny](http://mods.mybb.com/view/rate-me-a-funny "MyBB plugin page with screenshot")
lets you rate each user in a postbit. You can edit which kinds of ratings are avaiable where and which groups can use it. you can also edit where it's not avaliable and which groups cannot use it. there's even an option if people can multirate (but this option doesn't exist for groups or forum. It's global)

There is a todo list, but I'm busy fixing this website right now.


### Minecraft Premium User
The plugin
[Minecraft Premium User](http://mods.mybb.com/view/minecraft-premium-user "MyBB plugin page with screenshot")
is my first ever created plugin for MyBB. Someone wanted me to make a plugin for MyBB where a tool can verify if a user has a premium account. This plugin then switches the user to a "minecraft group" or if the administrator changed the group to something else. Then, it will switch the user to the different group.

This plugin might not be very secure, but the users in the forum has to believe that their adminitrator isn't trying to steal their account. There is a guy who is making a MC userlogin right now, I will probably update the plugin with that API.

### Many New Posts
This plugin is called
[Many New Posts](http://mods.mybb.com/view/many-new-posts "MyBB plugin page with screenshot")
shows how many new posts have been made since the last time the user saw it. The user can also just click on the box that is showing the amount of posts made and it will direct the user to the first post made ever since the user saw the thread. This will expire based on forum settings on how long til the thread title highlight expires.

This plugin is final. I will not add anything new to it.
